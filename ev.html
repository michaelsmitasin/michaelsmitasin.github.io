<h2>1-Year Stats (2022-03-23 to 2023-03-23):</h2>
<ul>
<li>Miles: 10,794</li>
<li>kWh: 3,306</li>
<li>Avg Efficiency: 306 Wh/mi</li>
<li>Charging Costs: $757.82</li>
<li>Avg Cost per kWh: $0.23</li>
</ul>
</p>
 
<p>
<h2>TL;DR, things learned:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don’t buy a Level-2 (240V) charger unless you drive more miles than you can recharge at Level-1 (120V).</li>
<li>For DC fast charging on road trips: make frequent, short stops instead of infrequent, long stops. You’ll spend less time overall due to nonlinear charging rates, and if you take those few minutes to use the restroom, get a snack, stretch, it’ll go by much faster.</li>
<li>Do more research before buying, don’t just assume a car has a feature because it seems like it should.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<h2>Time Spent Charging at home:</h2>
</br>
Average of 5kWh and <b>4 hours per day with Level 1 charging</b>, 12A @ 120V (1.44kW)</br>
Cost: ~$0.13 per kWh or ~$0.68/day
</br>
</p>

I’ve tracked this closely to decide whether or not it would be worth it to upgrade to a Level 2 charger at home - my initial assumption is I’d have to do this, but after a year, the data shows that this is completely unnecessary given my usage. For how little I drive day-to-day, my Level 1 home charger (which came with the car at the time) is more than sufficient.
</p>
<p>
Upgrading to a Level 2 charger would cost, at minimum, $200 (with utility EVSE discount), assuming I do all the work myself, and can reuse the A/C circuit from the garage subpanel, which would be less-than-ideal. More realistically, it would probably be closer to ~$1000 for a dedicated circuit, possibly ran from the main panel. However, there’s just not sufficient benefit to justify that - I can think of one, maybe two times in the last year that I would have benefited from the L2 charger: once when we were doing a lot of driving one weekend, and once when my family was visiting and also rented a Model 3. In both of those cases, a $10-$20 DC faster charger stop would have helped with the anxiety, but neither ended up being an actual problem.
