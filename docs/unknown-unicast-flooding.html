2020-12-26: I had originally posted this in November of 2014, just about a year and three months after having started work as a Network Engineer. I'm sure that the implementation specifics of FreeBSD aliases and Juniper storm control have changed since then, so this may no longer be relevant to modern installations, but I think the tale of troubleshooting is an interesting one, and this provides a peek into the perspective of an early-career Network Engineer. I've copied over the content as-is, with only reformatting to match my current site.

Hopefully this will be useful to other people who’ve also implemented <a href="http://www.juniper.net/techpubs/en_US/junos12.3/topics/concept/rate-limiting-storm-control-understanding.html">storm control on Juniper EX series switches (PDF)</a>. This has been tricky to locate, but I believe I now understand the root cause and have found a way to quickly and easily identify this specific situation (which seems like it could crop up easily). Why should you care if this is happening? Well, it could mean dropping a lot of traffic… but more about that later.
