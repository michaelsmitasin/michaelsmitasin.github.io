<h3>Cloudification Complete</h3>
<p>
I've finished converting my personal website and services to SaaS providers, with email being the final one to move. After years of running my own servers, DNS, network, and email, I'd decided it was time to simplify. I still run a fairly complex home network but at least my public-facing services are simpler to manage and maintain, and should require less time and effort on my part. This was all a wonderful learning experience, but my professional focus is different than it was almost 10 years ago, and keeping this all running myself no longer holds the same appeal... or at least, given the free time I have, I'd just rather be doing other things. There are a lot of restaurants and coffee shops to check out, rivers/lakes to kayak, and running/hiking/snowshoeing trails to explore.
