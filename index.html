<h3>Cloudification</h3>
<p>
I've decided to start moving everything to ~SaaS providers in order to reduce effort and costs for maintaining my site, email, and DNS. Having done all the roll-your-own infrastructure stuff for years, I think I've had my fill, and am moving toward more API/scripting work in my professional life as well, so this better aligns with the work I'm doing there. Originally, I had been planning to Puppetize all my VMs, but then started thinking about Docker/Kubernetes, and ultimately decided to just go with off-the-shelf SaaS stuff given I have so little custom requirements (these are all static pages, for example). A few things may be broken for the time being, like real-time temperature graphs, and I'm removing the nullroutes page as well since it's no longer relevant. I may replace it with some stats from the Cloudflare or Github API or something. In summary:
<ul>
<li>Moving static pages to Github Pages, front-ended by Cloudflare.</li>
<li>Moving DNS to Cloudflare.</li>
<li>Maybe moving email to Gmail.</li>
</ul>
